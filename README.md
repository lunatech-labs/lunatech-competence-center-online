# lunatech-competence-center-online
CCO is the Competence Center Online for Lunatech employees.

## Contact and Information
Erik Bakker is the initiator of the Competence Center and oversees all sub projects.

## Purpose
The Competence Center will become a portal in which Lunatech employees can track their development and where to improve their development via training or workshop. On the other side it gives Client directors / Sales insight into who will fit in which project based on experience and knowledge.

## Structure
- Frontend: Polymer web application. 
- Backend: Finch http service
- Fonts: helper project containing fonts for the PDF generation

The whole application is deployed as a Docker application on Clever Cloud. 

The frontend is served via NGINX, the backend application on port 9000 is linked to /api in NGINX. The database is hosted on Clever Cloud as well. 

## How to run
- The application can use a PostgreSQL db on Clever Cloud see [config](backend/src/main/resources/application.conf)
- For a local db: 
    - Configure a PostgreSQL server with the provided [schema](backend/src/main/resources/schema.sql)
    - install PostgreSQL via `brew install postgres`
    - `/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/<INSERT YOUR POSTGRES VERSION NUMBER (e.g., 9.6.2)>/bin/createuser -s postgres`
    - `createdb -O postgres competence-center` (if this returns `createdb: could not connect to database`, try `brew services stop postgresql; brew services start postgresql`)
    - The Schema will automatically be loaded by [Flyway](http://flaywaydb.org) when the application starts.
- [Build and serve frontend](frontend/README.md)
- [Run the backend](backend/README.md)

2. Edit / Create CV data for yourself
3. Generate a CV based on (a subset of) CV data
