# Board Generator #

This small Java library will help you generate random boards for the Battleship
project.

## Usage
For almost every JVM language you should be able to copy and paste this code in
your project and get it up and running.

If you have any problems, you could package this project as a library an use the
`.jar` file:

```
mvn package
```

That Maven command should do the trick.
