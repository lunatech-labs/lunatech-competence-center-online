## Running locally

Prepare yourself, it's not as smooth as some other applications. We'll make it better in the future.

To fully run the application, you need to configure your environment and run 4 things (in 4 terminals):

* The Postgres database
* The backend
* The frontend
* Nginx

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following things installed:

* Docker
* nginx

### Configuring your environment

This application depends on the [Lunatech People API](https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-people-api) and on the [EventBrite](http://eventbrite.com) API. This being a public repo, we can't add credentials for those API's here. Instead, you need to use a Secure Channel (tm) to obtain them; which consists of contacting Erik Bakker.

Once you have API keys for EventBrite and the People API, do the following:

* Copy `backend/src/main/resources/environment-specific-template.conf` to `backend/src/main/resources/environment-specific.conf` and put in that file the API keys.

### Postgres database

    scripts/run_db.sh

### Backend

    cd backend
    sbt "~re-start"

Use `scalafix RemoveUnusedImports` for cleaning up imports


### Frontend

    scripts/link_local_polymer_components.sh

    cd frontend
    npm install
    polymer serve

In case of conflicts, remove the bower_components and redo steps described above.

### nginx

    scripts/run_local_nginx.sh


### Observe

Browse to http://localhost:8080/ to see the application. 
There is also a GUI running on top of the Postgres database, reach it on http://localhost:8088/ and login with username `postgres`, password `secret` and database `competence-center`.
